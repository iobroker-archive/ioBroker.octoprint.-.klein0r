## Important!

DO NOT restart your OctoPrint instance (or any other instance) with code like this:

```javascript
var obj = getObject('system.adapter.octoprint.0');
obj.common.enabled = false;
setObject('system.adapter.octoprint.0', obj);
```

Since the `API key` is a protected attribute since version 1.1.0, this will remove the configured API key. The reason is, that `getObject` doesn't return protected information (so the api key is not included in the returned object). When you save the object, you will save an object without the key.

Please use state `system.adapter.octoprint.0.alive` to stop/start the instance.
